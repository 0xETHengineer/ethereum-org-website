# QA Testing contributions

The QA testing contributions is an initiative to test release candidates for ethereum.org before they are deployed into production.

On Tuesdays we create a release candidate that goes into the staging branch. Information about the release candidate will be posted in the # ðŸ‘¾ ï½œ website-code in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ethereum-org). You can also find the release notes for the release candidate in the [releases page](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/releases) on the GitHub repository. The release candidate will be tagged as a `pre-release` until it has been merged into master. After QA testing, we deploy the release candidate into production if there are no release blocking bugs found on Thursday. More info on the deploy process for ethereum.org can be found [here](docs/deploy-process.md).

If you would like to get involved in testing release candidates, please say hi in the # ðŸ‘¾ ï½œ website-code channel of the Discord. We also host bi-weekly community testing events held in Discord and [gather.town](https://www.gather.town/) where we all hop on together to test the release candidate. Come join and say hi!
