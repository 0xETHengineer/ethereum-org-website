# Participating in a funding round {#participating}

There are two ways to participate: as an **ethereum.org contributor**, or as an **allocator**.

## Ethereum.org contributors (2019-present) {#ethereumorg-contributors}

Contributors to ethereum.org will have a period of time to apply for funding before a funding round starts. Anyone who meets the [eligibility criteria](#eligibility-criteria) are encouraged to apply during this time.

Applications from ethereum.org contributors are accepted up until a funding round begins.

Contributions can be from (but not limited to) any of the following categories:

- <Emoji text="🌐" me={1} /> Translations
- <Emoji text="📝" me={1} /> Content
- <Emoji text="📖" me={1} /> Documentation
- <Emoji text="📐" me={1} /> Design
- <Emoji text="🐞" me={1} /> Bug reports
- <Emoji text="👩‍💻" me={1} /> Code/development
- <Emoji text="👨‍🦯" me={1} /> Accessibility
- <Emoji text="🏛️" me={1} /> Infrastructure
- <Emoji text="🔧" me={1} /> Tooling
- <Emoji text="💿" me={1} /> Data
- <Emoji text="🤝" me={1} /> Community

### Eligibility criteria {#eligibility-criteria}

- **Project** - A "project" refers to a contributor to the **ethereum.org website domain or subdomains**. Contributors ("projects") can apply as individuals or as collectives, noting only one Ethereum address will be used for payout.
- **Completed work** - Contribution must have been performed in the past—funding is not intended for future/planned work.
- **Evidence** - Must provide public link to clear evidence of contribution. This is both for the operating team, as well as for donors participating in a round to see.
- **Financial disclosures** - Applicants who may have previously received funding for their work associated with a contribution are welcome to apply, but for the sake of transparency are required to disclose this amount publicly.
- **Time period** - Contributions are currently allowed from any time since 2019, which marked the v1.0.1 release of the current code repository.
- **Excluded parties**
  - Round will be managed by members of the ethereum.org core team who are ineligible to receive matching funds.
  - Full-time employees/contractors of the Ethereum Foundation are not eligible to receive matching funds.

Eligibility criteria are subject to change, and disputes will be arbitrated by the ethereum.org core team. For questions reach out to us on [Discord](/discord/).

## Allocators {#allocators}

Once a funding round begins, **anyone** is allowed to help allocate the matching pool funds by signaling their support for the ethereum.org contributions listed. This is done by making a small donations of ETH or DAI (minimum of $1 USD worth) to any contribution you'd like to support.

<ExpandableCard
title="Wait, I have to pay for this?"
contentPreview="Ethereum.org is using Allo Protocol by Gitcoin to execute funding rounds">
Allo Protocol by Gitcoin utilizes a mechanism called <strong>quadratic funding</strong> to allocate funds democratically, optimizing for human impact.

Your donation represents your vote in how the matching funds should be <em>allocated</em>.

The funds in the matching pool are intended to be the main source of funding—donations by participants are meant to signal where they'd prefer the matching pool funds to be allocated, while keeping votes scarce (unlimited free votes would break the model).

<ExpandableCard

contentPreview="$1 is the minimum—you can do more, but that will do">
Quadratic funding cares more about <em>how many unique individuals</em> found a contribution valuable, and less about the total value that was donated to each project... a <strong>$1 donation is plenty</strong> (the minimum allowed per project by Allo Protocol), and can be matched by significantly more if others agree.

You are welcome to strengthen your vote by donating more, but each additional dollar donated will have diminishing returns on the matching pool funds.
</ExpandableCard>

**Note that 100% of all donations go directly to the recipient Ethereum address.**

You can view all submitted contributions to see a summary of each. If you've found a contribution to be impactful, you're encouraged to show your support for this contributor to receive more matching funds by adding them to your shopping cart.

When ready, you can checkout using the shopping cart by finalizing the amounts you'd like to donate before sending the funds using your wallet.

## What funds will I need? {#needed-funds}

Rounds are being held using the Allo Protocol on the Optimism layer 2 rollup, for on-chain transparency and inexpensive network fees. As such you’ll need an Ethereum address with some ETH available _on Optimism_ to be used for transaction fees (gas).

As an **ethereum.org contributor** looking to receive funding, you’ll need some ETH on Optimism for:

1. Gas when registering yourself as a "project"
2. Gas when applying to a funding round with your "project"

As an **allocator**, you’ll need Optimism ETH for:

1. Gas when submitting your donations
2. Your donation itself (or optionally, you can use [DAI on Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1) for this)

<ExpandableCard
title="How much will gas cost?"
contentPreview="On Optimism, total fees should be anywhere from ~$0.25-$2">

Total transaction fees for an ethereum.org contributor registering as a project should be under 0.001 ETH.

Total fees for allocators will depend on number of contributors you’re supporting, but should in general be less than 0.002 ETH in total.

## When a round is over {#round-over}

When a round is completed, the results will be calculated, reviewed, and then funds will be distributed based on the final results. Contributors who received donations will receive these donations and their associated portion of the matching pool to the Ethereum address provided during registration.
