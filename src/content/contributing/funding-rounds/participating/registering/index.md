# Registering for funding as an ethereum.org contributor {#registering-for-funding}

As an ethereum.org contributor looking to receive funding during a funding round, there are a couple things you'll need to do **before round allocations begin**:

1. Creating a "project" for yourself
1. Applying to a funding round

## Step 1: Creating a "project" for yourself {#step-1}

First, you'll need to register yourself as a "project" using Gitcoin's Grant Stack. This step is about you, and _not yet_ about your contributions to ethereum.org—you'll get a chance to describe your contribution(s) and provide a receiving address in a later step.

Follow along below, or check out the Gitcoin support docs, _[How to create a project in Builder](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/project-owners/how-to-create-a-project-in-builder)_, for additional guidance.

1. **Get connected** to Gitcoin Builder:

   - Go to [Gitcoin Builder New Project](https://builder.gitcoin.co/#/projects/new)
   - Connect wallet
   - Switch network to Optimism

2. **Provide project details**:

   - _Project Name_ - This is your name, or whatever identifier others will recognize (if you’ve contributed as a team, you can use a team name here)
   - _Project Website_ - Link to your preferred social profile (or your own website if you have one)
   - _Project Logo, Project Banner (optional)_ - Avatar and banner images for your project profile
   - _Project Description_ - Describe your interest in ethereum.org, and what potential impact could result from receiving funds

3. **Provide socials** _(optional)_:

   - If you’re contribution involved code contributions or anything on GitHub, it is recommended to provide this for clarity

4. **Preview and publish**:

   - Confirm your details, then "Save and Publish" to submit your transaction on Optimism (requires some ETH on Optimism for transaction fee)

## Step 2: Applying to a round {#step-2}

Once you have a project for yourself, you'll need to apply to an active round. Follow along here, or see the Gitcoin support docs, _[How to apply to a round in Explorer](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/project-owners/how-to-apply-to-a-round-in-explorer)_, for additional guidance.

<!-- TODO: Figure out how to link to round(s) without manual updates here -->
<!-- Explorer link: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/round-contract-address -->

1. **Get connected** to the funding round:

   - Go to <CurrentFundingRound roundInterface="explorer">Gitcoin Explorer for the current round</CurrentFundingRound>
   - Make sure you're connected to the same wallet used to create your project
   - Confirm network is on **Optimism**

2. **Start** application

   - Review application period and round eligibility
   - Click **Apply** to continue
   - Select your project from the list

There can be a delay after selecting your project. Give it a moment, and form details should be displayed beneath the selector. If you don't see anything after 30 seconds, try refreshing the page.

3. **Provide** contribution details - Required fields include:

   - _Email address_ - Not displayed publicly, used to contact you if there are any issues with your application
   - _Prior funding for work_ - Must disclose any prior funding for work being submitted, such as previous grant rounds—if none, simply write "none"
   - _Contribution description_
     - This is your space to describe the contribution(s) you’ve made, and its impact... _let people know why your contribution should be valued!_
     - **This field has rich-text support using markdown**, so don’t be afraid to express yourself, and make sure users can easily see what you’ve worked on
     - This means you can also embed screenshots using URLs and additional links as needed, though you'll need a place to host these images (i.e. [GitHub](https://github.com), [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), etc.)
     - You can preview your submission in the next step
     - [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
   - _Primary contribution link_ - Link out to publicly available evidence of your contribution. This could be a link to contributions on GitHub, Crowdin, Discord, or directly to a page affected on ethereum.org. You may optionally provide additional URLs in the fields provided, or in your contribution description.

4. **Preview and publish**:

   - Click **Preview Application** to see a preview of your submission
   - Use _Back to Editing_ " to make any changes, or click **Submit** if everything looks good
   - Once submitted, the entry **cannot be changed**. Please make sure everything is correct before proceeding. Clicking **Proceed** will submit your transaction on Optimism (requires some ETH on Optimism for transaction fee)
   - To encrypt your data, you must also sign-in again with your wallet—this does not cost additional gas

After you’ve applied, you’re submission will enter the review process. You can view your project profile and the status of your application by going to <a href="https://builder.gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin Builder</a>.

## Step 3: Spread the word! {#step-3}

<Emoji text="📣" fontSize="3xl" me={2} /> Tell others about the round and make sure folks know you’ve applied! Encourage others to check out the round when it goes live and add their voice in how the funds are distributed.

Lastly, when round allocations begin, be sure to also participate as an allocator _yourself_ to get a say in how the funds are distributed!
